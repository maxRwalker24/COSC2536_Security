Implements hybrid encryption, combining AES (symmetric) and RSA (asymmetric) cryptography.

RSA keys are generated with 2048-bit key size; the public key encrypts the AES key, and the private key decrypts it.

A random AES-256 key is generated for encrypting the actual message.

AES encryption uses CFB mode with a random initialization vector (IV) and PKCS7 padding to handle block alignment.

The AES key is encrypted with RSA using OAEP padding for secure key transmission.

The encrypted message, IV, and encrypted AES key are returned for storage or transmission.

The decryption function reverses the process: RSA decrypts the AES key, then AES decrypts the message, and PKCS7 padding is removed.

The script demonstrates end-to-end encryption and decryption, printing the original message, encrypted message, IV, encrypted AES key, and decrypted message.

Designed for experimentation and learning about combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption for secure communications.
